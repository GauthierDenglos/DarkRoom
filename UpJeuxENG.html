            <p class="Text">
                We decided to add subtitles in the introductory kinematic of our game, The longest was to find a good way to do and find the right timings for each piece of dialogue. The animation itself was quite simple and repetitive. I decided to add black outlines so that the test was better, choose the size, the placement on the screen and the moment it appears and disappears.

                The music was so far alone in the game scene and we decided to change that: Now at the end of each kinematic, a different music starts, more rhythmic and more stressful than the previous one. All this is handled by the audio manager whereas before the music was not managing, since only one. Thanks to that the player will probably be bored less, and in addition to the clock, he will have a second indicator that will show him his progress in the game!

                For this second oral, the design of our game and its overall appearance has greatly evolved! We move from empty rooms that contain only keys to rooms filled with new assets and pickups. The pickups (keys, hammers, flashlight...) were fully modeled by us, only a few sets of objects do not belong to us for the sake of time and also because we preferred to dwell on the gameplay of the game rather than the many objects filling. The doors have also changed design as expected, they go from simple rectangles to doors a little more detailed (finally!). Blood stains have also been added as textures on the walls and some floors to reinforce the horror side of our game.

            <p class="Text"> We solved some problems including the fact that the lamp turned on itself and changed orientation when it encountered other objects. We have also added a battery system, the player will have a limited time of use of the lamp, adding a stress effect on the player. We also made the light cast shadows when it encounters an obstacle. </p>

                A kinematic introduction has been added! With the voices of Gauthier and Ilona to play the two protagonists of our history. We thus set a starting context, concise enough to be both clear but mysterious. The player is therefore launched in this plot after the kidnapper of our main heroine has explained the rules of his unhealthy "game".
                This kinematic was realized with the animator of Unity, the images that we see there are therefore the images of the game directly. We do not see any of the characters because the playeris directly immersed in an FPS view.
                But do not detail this kinematic to leave you the surprise.

In addition was added a special music for the game mode "discovery", lighter and fun than that of the classic game mode. A SoundManager has also been created which will manage all the sound effects, especially for inserts the sound of doors creaking when opened. This manager will greatly facilitate the management of all other upcoming sound effects.</p>
