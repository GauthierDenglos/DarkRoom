			<blockquote>
				<p>Alone in a room where there is almost total darkness, simple facts such as who you are, or what year are we, no longer matter and seem to have been totally erased from your brain. The only feeling you have left is an intense fear, and the only thought you have is a will to survive, to come out of that unknown place from which your instinct screams you to flee as soon as possible. Only two questions cross your mind: "Where am I? Why am I here? ". At this moment, resounding in the whole room, a hoarse voice sends chills down your spine with these few words ... </p>

            <p class="Log"> <b> After the fisrt oral </b> <i>- 13/03/2018 </i> </p>
            <!--CONTENT-->
            <p class="Text"> For this first oral, we already had our menu, the main model of our game environment and a very simple gameplay start.</p>
            <figure> <img src="Images/menu_principal.png" alt="Logo" class="Image" width=25%> </figure>
            <p class="Text"> Our game already had a functional menu with buttons pointing to the game, the options (not yet fully functional) and the ability to leave the game. The two game modes Multiplayer and Discovery are not yet implemented. </p>
            <figure> <img src="Images/maquettefinish.jpg" alt="Logo" class="Image" width=25%> </figure>
            <p class="Text"> The 3 pieces of our game were modeled then assembled. The soil is the only one to have a texture, this model therefore only needs to be improved! Later we will add textures for the walls as well as more details. The doors are quite simple, they were intended to test the animations and the interactions between the keys and the doors, these will also be improved. Finally, lights are also present in every room to give an atmosphere to each of them. Details must be adjusted, including light sources that are currently simple shapes (cylinders and squares) but later will be real lamps and neon models.</p>
            <p class="Text">
                For the gameplay, the only actions possible are the movement of the character and its camera as well as the interactions with the objects.
                The movement of the character in FPS was tricky enough to handle because you have to be able to move not only the character but also the camera attached to it.
                In terms of interactions, the player is able to pick up collectible items, "pickups" and interact with other elements of the decor, such as keys that open doors and trigger animations.
             </p>
            <figure> <img src="Images/inventaire.jpg" alt="Logo" class="Image" width=25%> </figure>
            <p class="Text"> Finally, in order to manage and see the different pickups, an inventory has been added. This one also only needs to be improved by adding the possibility of looking at objects more closely and being able to turn them with the mouse directly in the inventory. </p>
