            <p class="Text">
                The music was so far alone in the multi scene and we decided to change that: Now at the end of each cutscene, a different music starts, more rhythmic and more stressful than the previous one. All this is handled by the audio manager whereas before the music was not managing, since only one. So the player will probably be bored less and in addition to the clock, he will have a second indicator that will show him his progress in the game!

                For this second defense, the design of our game and its overall appearance has greatly evolved! We move from empty rooms that contain only keys to rooms filled with new assets and pickups. The pickups (keys, hammers, flashlight) were fully modeled by us, only a few sets of objects do not belong to us for the sake of time and also because we preferred to dwell on the gameplay of the game rather than the many objects filling. The doors have also changed design as expected, they go from simple rectangles to doors a little more detailed (finally!). Blood stains have also been added as textures on the walls and some floors to reinforce the horror side of our game.

                A cinematic introduction has been added! With the voices of Gauthier and Ilona to play the two protagonists of our history. We thus set a starting context, concise enough to be both clear but mysterious. The player is therefore launched in this plot after the kidnapper of our main heroine has explained the rules of his "game" unhealthy.
                This cinematic was realized with the animator of Unity, the images that we see there are therefore the images of the game directly. We do not see any of the characters because the player is directly immersed in an FPS view.
                But do not detail this cinematic to leave you the surprise.

A margin has been added to center everything and make reading more enjoyable, especially when texts are long. Added to this are the font changes, between titles, texts, and passages in italics (quote). The rest of the simple layout by playing with HTML.</br> </p>
            <p class="Text"> Deuxièmement, l'organisation générale : Certaines parties ajoutées au premier abord n'étaient en fait pas necessaire, ou trop lourde pour être ajoutées au site, et donc réparties, ou supprimées. C'est le cas par exemple de tous les tableaux (aussi présents dans le cahier des charges), qui on été remplassé par cette partie Updates, remplie au fur et à mesure. </br> </p>

            <p class="Text"> Thirdly, the filling: it is in doing this that the other points have come. By filling the site we realized the heaviness of some things, and the need to make the site more ergonomic. Despite this, filling is necessary, arrangements have been made and fill the site and now easier with the new organization. We know where this thing is, and what it should look like. This is the last step before having a complete site, which we can improve if we have the time.</br> </p>

            <p class="Text"> The 3 pieces of our game were modeled then assembled. The soil is the only one to have a texture, this model therefore only needs to be improved! Later we will add textures for the walls as well as more details. The doors are quite simple, they were intended to test the animations and the interactions between the keys and the doors, these will also be improved. Finally, lights are also present in each room to give an atmosphere to each of them. Details must be set including light sources that are currently simple simple shapes (cylinders and squares) but later will be real lamps and neon models.</p>
            <p class="Text">
                For the gameplay, the only possible actions are the movement of the character and its camera as well as the interactions with the objects.
                 The movement of the character in FPS was tricky enough to handle because you have to be able to move not only the character but also the camera attached to it.
                 In terms of interactions, the player is able to pick up collectible items, "pickups" and interact with other elements of the decor, such as keys that open doors and trigger animations.
