			<p class="Text"> We are 4 to participate in the development of this -we hope- great project that is DarkRoom. First-year students at Epita in Paris, we will make every effort to create a game that appeals to our players, and especially that we like! We hope to take pleasure in its realization and take advantage of this project to expand our field of knowledge in programming and creation. So come contribute to this great experience with us! 🙂 </p>

				<p> 19 years student in first year of preparatory class at EPITA, I did very little computer programmating before being taken to EPITA and I do not regret my choice! The discovery of computer science opens me to universes that I did not know or very little, and the creation of a video game is one of them. I discovered the back of the scenes related to its manufacture and I am very happy not to be alone for this project! <cite> Ilona Poilliot</cite></p>

			<blockquote>
				<p> Being currently a student at Epita in the first year of the preparatory cycle, I must realize a computer project with other students of my class. To introduce myself simply, I am very dynamic and I really appreciate the work in group (in the case where everyone participates). It turns out that our group is very enthusiastic about the design of our game, despite the difficulties that are coming ahead. I am just as motivated as they are and I cannot wait to see the result of our investment!<cite> Marile Lin</cite> </p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				<p> Being a great fan of video games but also passionate about creation and programming, it is with great joy that I embark on this project that is important to me as much in its history as in the possibilities it offers us. This project and the team I'm going to work with are very motivating and push me to enrich myself with knowledge that I hope will always be useful in a professional environment! <cite> Emma Leroy</cite></p>

			<blockquote>
				<p> Student in computer science, and eager to discover the different aspects of a video game, this project makes me discover the pains but also and greatfully the joys behind the creation of such a universe. Exploring many different branches of computer science, this game will allow me to give free run to my imagination and that of my partners, but also know how to make sacrifices, and organize a project. I can only flourish beeing surrounded by such a team and with the aim of such a project! <cite>Gauthier Denglos</cite> </p>

			<h1 class="Titre"> The gameplay </h1> 
 
      			<p class="Text"> When the player selects the "Story Mode", the game begins. We decided that the player would have a point of view in the first person, instead of seeing the player move in his environment, the player sees through his eyes, as if he was himself the character. This kind of view seems ideal for an Escape Game, which is meant to be the most immersive game possible for the player to fully engage in the story and challenges presented to him. It will begin in a short cinematic in which the character wakes up in a bed located inside a dark room. In the story we will implement an antagonistic character, it is because of this that the player is in the Escape Game. The antagonist goes to the beginning of the game to speak through a speaker to locate the basics of the story of DarkRoom. During the cinematics and the game phase, it will happen that the main character also speaks. These dialogs will be all in English, but with default French subtitles, which the player will be able to desactivate or modify in the options of the game. After the introductory cinematics, the player can begin to move his character in the room. At this point there will be a short tutorial in which the user can discover the keys that are useful to the game, he will learn how to move his character in one direction, how to pick up an object, how to observe a clue or open his inventory. Then the player will be free of these movements. The character is initially in a room of a building. His goal is to get out of the room to access the other two rooms on the floor, until he finishes the game by finding the last object on the floor. The player has a limited time of one hour, so it must spend a maximum of 20 minutes per piece.
      			The three rooms he can access are: <br/> • A room (1st room, where the character wakes up at the beginning of the game) <br/>
                                  • A bathroom / toilet (2nd room) <br/>
                                  • A laundry room (3rd and last room) </p>
